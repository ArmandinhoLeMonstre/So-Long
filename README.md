Based on a library named "Mini LibX" ;

MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa.

S\o to this Gitbook : https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html
By doing this project I learned how to do backtracking, parsing a map and use basic stuff from Mini Libx
Feel free to try it with whatever type of map you want, you need those conditions :

Rectangular map, First line and last line + columns should be "1" (walls)
1 "E", 1 "P", and more than 1 "C", all of those have to be reachable.
CHAMA OU NAO CHAMA !
